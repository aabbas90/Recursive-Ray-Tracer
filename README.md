# Recursive-Ray-Tracer
Implementation of a Ray-Tracer for Rendering in C++ carried out for the course of Computer Graphics at Saarland University.
The goal of the project was to implement Ray-Tracing without using any Rendering Library for a developing a deeper understanding of
Rendering concepts.

## Features:
- Spatial Indexing (BVH)
- Material Models
- Texturing and Texture Filtering
- Stochastic Ray Tracing:
  - Depth of Field
  - Anti-Aliasing
  - Motion-blur
  - Fuzzy Reflections/Refractions
  - Soft Shadows
- Camera with an LCD placed inside scene
  
## Requirements:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (C++)
